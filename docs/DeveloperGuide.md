## Setting up, getting started

## Design
{From course website: 
you may omit the Architecture section (no penalty)
if you have not organized the code into clearly divided components (no penalty if you didn't), you can use a single class diagram (if it is not too complicated) or use several class diagrams each describing a different area of the system.}

### Implementation
