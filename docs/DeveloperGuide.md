## Setting up, getting started

## Design

{From course website:
you may omit the Architecture section (no penalty)
if you have not organized the code into clearly divided components (no penalty if you didn't), you can use a single
class diagram (if it is not too complicated) or use several class diagrams each describing a different area of the
system.}

### Implementation

{TODO BY 02/04/2025: Each member should describe the implementation of at least one enhancement they have added (or
planning to add).}

#### Adding Books

#### Adding Loans

The `add-loan` feature allows the user to add a loan for a book in the inventory. The loan includes details such as the borrower's name, return date, phone number, and email. The system ensures that the book exists in the inventory and is not already on loan before creating the loan.

`InputHandler` coordinates with `InputParser`, `BookList`, `LoanList`, `Formatter`, and `Storage` classes to implement the feature.

The following UML sequence diagram shows how the `add-loan BOOK_TITLE n/BORROWER_NAME d/RETURN_DATE p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL` command is handled.

![addLoan.png](images/addLoan.png)

1. User issues command:
   The user inputs the command in the CLI with the required arguments, e.g., `add-loan The Great Gatsby n/John Doe d/2025-03-28 p/98765432 e/john.doe@example.com`.

2. Command arguments are extracted:
   `InputHandler` first calls `InputParser.extractCommandArgs(...)` to split the user input into command arguments.  
   - For example, the input `add-loan The Great Gatsby n/John Doe d/2025-03-28 p/98765432 e/john.doe@example.com` is split into:
     - `commandArgs[0]`: `"add-loan"`
     - `commandArgs[1]`: `"The Great Gatsby n/John Doe d/2025-03-28 p/98765432 e/john.doe@example.com"`

3. Loan arguments are parsed:
   `InputHandler` invokes `InputParser.extractAddLoanArgs(...)` to parse the second part of the command (`commandArgs[1]`) into the following components:
   - Book title
   - Borrower's name
   - Return date
   - Phone number
   - Email

4. Book is validated:
   `InputHandler` calls `BookList.findBookByTitle(bookTitle)` to check if the book exists in the inventory.  
   - If the book is not found, `InputHandler` uses `Formatter` to print a "Book not found in inventory" message and exits early.
   - If the book is found, the flow continues.

5. Loan status is validated:
   `InputHandler` checks if the book is already on loan using `Book.getOnLoan()`.  
   - If the book is already on loan, `InputHandler` uses `Formatter` to print a "The book is currently out on loan" message and exits early.
   - If the book is not on loan, the flow continues.

6. Loan is created:
   If the book exists and is not already on loan:
   - A new `Loan` object is created using the parsed arguments.
   - The loan is added to the `LoanList` using `LoanList.addLoan(...)`.

7. Book status is updated:
   The book's `onLoan` status is updated to `true` using `Book.setOnLoan(...)`.

8. Changes are saved to persistent storage:
   `InputHandler` calls `Storage.saveLoans(...)` and `Storage.saveInventory(...)` to save the updated loan list and inventory.

9. Success message is displayed:
   `InputHandler` uses `Formatter` to print a message indicating that the loan was successfully added.


#### Removing Books

The `remove-book` feature allows the user to remove a book from the inventory using the book title as the identifier.
The system will first check if the book exists, remove all associated loans (if any) before finally removing the book
from the inventory. This prevents orphaned loan records from remaining in the system.

`InputHandler` coordinates with `BookList`, `LoanList` and `Formatter` classes to implement the feature.

The following UML sequence diagram shows how the `remove-book TITLE` command is handled.
![removeBook.png](images/removeBook.png)

1. User issues command:
   The user inputs the command in the CLI with the book title as an argument, e.g. `remove-book The Hobbit`

2. `InputHandler` first extracts command arguments by invoking `extractCommandArgs(...)`.
   Then, `removeBook(commandArgs)` is invoked to handle the command.

3. `BookList` is queried for the book:
   `InputHandler` calls `BookList.findBookByTitle(bookTitle)` to search for the book.
    - If the book is not found `(toRemove == null)`, `InputHandler` uses `Formatter` to print a "Book not found" message
      and exits early.
    - If the book is found, the flow continues.

4. Associated loans are removed:
   `LoanList.removeLoansByBook(toRemove)` is called to remove all loans associated with the book. This ensures no
   orphaned loans are left behind.

5. Book is removed from the system:
   `InputHandler` calls `BookList.removeBook(toRemove)` to remove the book.

6.  Changes are saved to persistent storage:
    `InputHandler` calls `Storage.saveInventory(...)` to save the updated inventory.

7. Success message is displayed:
   `Formatter` is used to print a message indicating successful removal.

#### Delete Loans
The `delete-loans` feature allows the user to remove a loan from the list of loans that is being tracked by using the book title and the borrower name as identifiers.
The program will check if first the book exists, then it will use the book object and the borrower name to search if the loan exist before proceeding to remove it. 

The following UML sequence diagram shows the behaviour of `delete-loans TITLE n/BORROWER_NAME`:
![delete_loan.png](images/deleteLoan.png)

1. User issues command:
   The user inputs the command with book title and borrower name as arguments e.g `delete-loan The Hobbit n/Mary`.

2. `InputHandler` extract command arguments with `extractCommandArgs(...)` followed by deleteLoan(commandArgs).

3. `InputHandler` calls `BookList.findBookByTitle(bookTitle)` to search for the book.
   `InputHandler` calls `LoanList.findLoans(bookTitle, borowerName)` to search for the loan.
    - If the book is not found `(loanedBook == null)`, not on loan, or there is no existing loan, `InputHandler` uses `Formatter` to print an error message and stops the command early.
    - If the book is found, the flow continues.

4. Delete corresponding loan:
   `InputHandler` calls `LoanList.deleteLoans(loan)` to delete the loan.

5. Sets book to not on loan:
   `InputHandler` calls loanedBook.setOnLoan(false).

6. Success message is displayed:
   `Formatter` is used to print a message indicating successful removal.
   
#### Viewing Books/Loans

#### Updating Books/Loans

#### Saving Inventory
The save inventory feature automatically saves the inventory each time the user makes a change. 
If no existing persistent storage file is detected, it will be created in `./data/bookKeeper_bookList.txt`
The method `saveInventory(bookList)` is invoked by `InputHandler` after any method call that makes changes to the current inventory.

The following UML sequence diagram shows the relevant behaviour:
![saveInventory.png](images/saveInventory.png)

1. Initiation: `InputHandler` invokes `Storage.saveInventory(bookList)`. 
2. Directory Check: A `File` object is created. Directory is created using `mkdirs()` if it does not already exist. 
3. FileWriter Creation: A new `FileWriter` is created for the file at `INVENTORY_FILE_PATH`. 
4. Retrieving Book List: `getBookList()` is called on the `BookList` instance passed into `saveInventory(bookList)` to obtain the list of `Book` objects. 
5. Writing Each Book: For each `Book` in the list, `toFileString()` is called to get a string representation. This string is then written to the file via `FileWriter`. 
6. Closing: After writing all books, `FileWriter` is closed. 

Error Handling: If an `IOException` occurs during any file operations, an error message is displayed via `Formatter.printBorderedMessage()`.
